Rock, Paper, Scissors* is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

* *Rock* (a closed fist)
* *Paper* (an open hand)
* *Scissors* (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended)

The rules are straightforward:

* *Rock* beats *Scissors* (rock breaks scissors)
* *Scissors* beats *Paper* (scissors cut paper)
* *Paper* beats *Rock* (paper covers rock)

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie and is usually replayed. The game is often used as a quick, fair way to make decisions and relies purely on chance, though some players try to predict opponents’ choices.
